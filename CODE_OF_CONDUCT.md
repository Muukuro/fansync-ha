# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

## Our Standards
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent and discuss technical disagreements with evidence.
- Focus feedback on code and behavior, not people.

## Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, hateful language, or personal attacks.
- Deliberate intimidation or abuse.
- Publishing private information without permission.

## Scope
This applies in project spaces, including issues, pull requests, discussions, and related communication channels.

## Reporting
Report concerns to the maintainer privately:
- Open a private security advisory for sensitive abuse/safety concerns where appropriate.
- Otherwise contact the repository owner directly through GitHub.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments/issues/PRs that violate this code of conduct and may restrict participation for repeated violations.
