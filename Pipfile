# Bleak pulls in pyobjc on macOS only; add platform markers so Linux CI doesn't try to build PyObjC
# On Linux/Windows, install bleak; on macOS for CI we generally don't run, but this keeps intent clear.
# Most importantly: prevent resolving macOS-only PyObjC wheels on Linux by excluding macOS from lock when generated on Linux.
